## Data Shared with Third Parties

For birthday message generation, Celebraite shares limited personal information with OpenAI. Specifically, the age computed from contact birth dates is sent to OpenAI's API to generate personalized birthday messages. Contact names are NOT sent to OpenAI; instead, a placeholder is used and the name is replaced locally on your device after the response is received.

The age information is processed by OpenAI according to their privacy policy and terms of service. No other personal contact information (such as names, phone numbers, email addresses, or other contact details) is shared with OpenAI or any other third party.

## Local Data Collection

I want to assure you that Celebraite does not collect or store any personal data from its users locally. No information such as name, email address, location, or any other personal data is required or stored by Celebraite on your device or on any servers I control.

## Anonymous Data Collected

While I do not collect personal data, Celebraite may collect anonymous information for statistical and user experience improvement purposes. This information may include aggregated data on application usage, popular features, potential errors, etc.

## Cookies and Similar Technologies

Celebraite does not use cookies or similar technologies to collect personal information or track user behavior.

## Data Security

I implement appropriate security measures to protect any potential non-personal information collected. The age data shared with OpenAI for message generation is transmitted securely over encrypted connections. Since I do not collect or store personal data locally, your sensitive contact information remains secure on your device.

## Changes to the Privacy Policy

I reserve the right to update this privacy policy at any time. All changes will be posted on this page, and the last updated date will also be modified.

## Contact

If you have any questions or concerns regarding my privacy policy, feel free to [contact me](/contact).
