## No Collection of Personal Data

I want to assure you that Celebraite does not collect any personal data from its users. No information such as name, email address, location, or any other personal data is required or stored by Celebraite.

## OpenAI and Contact Information

Celebraite uses OpenAI to generate birthday messages, but your contact information is never sent to OpenAI. The app sends only template prompt with placeholder variables (e.g., `{FIRST_NAME}`, `{AGE}`) to OpenAI. OpenAI returns non-personalized messages that preserve those placeholders. Then, the app replaces the placeholders locally on your device with the actual contact information. Your contact details remain private and are processed entirely on your device.

## Anonymous Data Collected

While Celebraite does not collect personal data, the app may collect anonymous information for statistical and user experience improvement purposes. This information may include aggregated data on application usage, popular features, potential errors, etc.

## Cookies and Similar Technologies

Celebraite does not use cookies or similar technologies to collect personal information or track user behavior.

## Data Security

Celebraite implements appropriate security measures to protect any potential non-personal information collected. However, since Celebraite does not collect any personal data, you can rest assured that your sensitive information is secure.

## Changes to the Privacy Policy

I reserve the right to update this privacy policy at any time. The last updated date is indicated at the bottom of this page. I encourage you to review this policy periodically to stay informed about how your information is being protected.
